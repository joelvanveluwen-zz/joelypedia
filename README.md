# Introduction

Inspired by [Nikita Voloboev](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/) this is a 'wiki of everything'. I stumbled across Voloboev's work from HackerNews just recently and a task like this was sitting in my personal Trello, how's that for serendipity. 

This wiki will be a constant work in progress but if you've got feedback or ideas feel free to raise an issue.

## Why a personalised "wiki of everything"?

Professional and personally I work on a lot of projects. This typically means \(a\) learning lots of new things and \(b\) breaking stuff and addressing things that haven't necessarily been publicly solved \(all hail Stack Overflow\). 

The wiki of everything will serve as an easy public reference for me and provide a platform to share some hints/tips/hacks I've found useful as a program manager, data scientist and analyst in the tech industry.
