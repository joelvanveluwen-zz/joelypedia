# Introduction

Inspired by [Nikita Voloboev](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/) this is a 'wiki of everything'. I stumbled across Voloboev's work from HackerNews just recently and a task like this was sitting in my personal Trello, how's that for serendipity. 

This wiki will be a constant work in progress but [if you've got feedback or ideas feel free to raise an issue](https://github.com/joelvanveluwen/joelypedia/issues/new).

## Why a personalised "wiki of everything"?

Professional and personally I work on a lot of projects. This typically means \(a\) learning lots of new things and \(b\) breaking stuff and addressing things that haven't necessarily been publicly solved \(all hail Stack Overflow\). 

The wiki of everything will serve as an easy public reference for me and provide a platform to share some hints/tips/hacks I've found useful as a program manager, data scientist and analyst in the tech industry. 

## If you're so busy how do you have time to write this stuff?

I didn't use the word busy! I have been learning on communities in Reddit, Stack Overflow and all corners of the internet for years \(from breaking Apache Spark to discovering missing or incomplete packages in Python libraries\). This platform will serve as a place to have Google indexable solutions and tips for some of the challenges I have had to overcome. It is the least I can do.
