# Github with 2FA

Github with 2FA will not work without a 'personal access token'. 

To generate this go to _'Settings' &gt; 'Developer settings' &gt; 'Personal access tokens'_ to generate a personal access token and set the authority levels. Remember to store your token somewhere securely as you won't be able to see it again after you leave the page.
